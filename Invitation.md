## Svelte

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in  the *browser*, Svelte shifts that work into a *compile step* that happens when you build your app.

Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that  surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.

Let's discover this world together on monday 25/05/20 - 13.00->17.00. You only need a keyboard and a listening ear.
