# Intro

So after the theorie, there comes the practice, in our workshop Project, i want to give you a better understanding of Svelte and his:

- Core Syntax
- Get a feeling for components.
- Learn about different types of components.
- Apply concepts in more realistic enviroments.

For this little project, i'm providing you with a link wher you can start a new slate, you can use your existing project, but i like a clean slate. I hope we can finish this one, but if we don't i am certain you will have at least the basics under the belt so you can experiment further on your own.
