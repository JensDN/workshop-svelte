# End
We arrived at the end of our first introduction to Svelte. We learned a lot about the base syntax of Svelte. we learned about events, how to pass data around our component, use styling  and some Element Directives. For the next part of this workshop, we gonna learn to use svelte outside this online REPL editor. So fasten your seat belts and let's go to The section 'Working with Conditionals & Loops'. But before we depart, are there any questions?
